    "Split the following message from Air Traffic Control into text with callsign and request like so. Split requests to multiple aircraft using a semicolon (\";\"). Keep in mind that there might be some artifacts from voice transcription in the callsign, you can simply ignore those and treat all callsigns as a 3-letter 4-digit block, regardless of how speech-to-text handles it. ONLY separate a message if the word \"break\" is used. Otherwise, keep the message for the single aircraft. Even if a message has a full-stop (period), do not split it unless \"break\" is used.",
