    "Taxi commands are returned as a list of waypoints. Waypoints are implicitly taxiways unless they are explicitly mentioned as a runway or a gate. Only hold short of a waypoint if it is preceted with \"hold short of\" or \"hold at\". Always use capital letters and numbers when creating gate or taxiway names.",
    "When the word \"via\" is used, append the waypoints before the \"via\" to the end of the list of waypoints. For example, \"Taxi to and hold short of runway 18 left via Alpha then Bravo\" would be returned as [\"A\", \"B\", \"18L\"]. Using \"via\" means: \"Go to this destination *via* these waypoints\" wheras the destination should be put last.",
    "IMPORTANT: \"then\" can be interchangable with \",\": \"Alpha then Bravo\" is the same as \"Alpha, Bravo\""
