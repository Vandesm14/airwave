# Interface

Airwave has four major parts of the interface:

1. Radar
2. Airspace and Frequency Panel
3. Stripboard
4. Chatbox

## Radar

To view aircraft in the air and on the ground, you will utilize the radar.

### Controls

You can click and drag to move the view around, and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

When you zoom in far enough into an airport, the radar type will switch from air to ground, allowing you to view taxiways, terminals, and gates.

## Airspace and Frequency Panel

This panel allows you to change the airspace, airport, and frequency you are controlling on.

## Stripboard

The stripboard is the core part of your workflow. It allows you to view incoming and outgoing aircraft that need your attention. It separates aircraft by state and sorts them by how long they've been active for.

## Chatbox

The chatbox displays a log of all of your messages between aircraft and allows you to toggle between your current frequency and all frequencies.
