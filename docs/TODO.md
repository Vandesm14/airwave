- radar can move and zoom
- airspaces & objects
	- runway
	- waypoints
- zoom to ground
- objects
	- terminal & gates
	- taxiways
	- runways
- select airport in dropdown
- switch to ground frequency
- aircraft in ground section on stripboard
- whole point of ground is departures and arrivals
- we have an aircraft that is a departure
- click him to see him on the radar
- radar info
	- callsign
	- speed
- identify the direction of departure
- pick a runway for the easiest route to depart
	- or less congested
- taxi command, including the taxiway to hold short at
- verify path and readback
	- touch on chatbox
- verify that last waypoint is red (will hold short)
- stripboard info on taxiway
- extended taxi information
	- touch on hold position & hold short
		- and continue taxi
	- also touch on giving taxi instructions again to change path
	- and touch on path only showing for selected aircraft
	- include taxiing multiple aircraft, telling them to go via different taxiways to keep lock-outs clear and other strategies
	- plus crossing vs holding short of runways
- stripboard info for takeoff (and holding short)
- once the aircraft is holding short, check if the runway is clear for him to line up
- if it is clear, continue taxi
- aircraft is lined up on the runway
- clear him to take off, providing the right runway number
	- ensure no aircraft are or will block the runway during the takeoff
- touch on 1000 feet limit for tower vs ground radar
- once the aircraft reaches the end of the runway, zoom out and wait for it to pop up on the radar
- once the aircraft is at 2000 or 3000 feet
	- direct through a departure
	- or to an arrival of the other airport
	- or as filed
- touch on altitude, speed, and heading management when departing
- ---
- arrivals
- when on center, they are under your jurisdiction
- they always fly towards your airspace
- radar info
	- callsign
	- altitude | target
	- heading | target
	- speed
- direct them through and approach or vector them manually
- pick the runway with the shortest path to them
- stripboard info on DCT
- once the aircraft is within the airspace circle, descend them to 4000 and set speed to 250
- as they near the approach, decrease their speed to 180-200 as needed before intercept
- once they are within range, clear them to land, given the runway number
- stripboard info on landing
- radar info on landing (ILS)
- touch on manual and auto go-arounds
	- and on vectoring them to a new runway
- zoom into ground after the aircraft is almost under 1000 feet
- wait for the aircraft to land (should see them on the ground radar)
- once they have landed, find an available gate
- taxi them to that gate
	- touch again on managing aircraft on the ground, including incremental taxi and such
- explain turn-around-time
