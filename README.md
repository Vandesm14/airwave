# Airwave

Airwave is a gamified airport simulator with airport management and realistic air traffic control (ATC) powered by your voice.

## Status

Airwave is currently in development. The game is absolutely playable if you're looking for a full-on simulation. However, we don't currently have a nice one-click installation flow, so setting it up requires some technical knowledge.

## Documentation

See [docs/](./docs/src/getting-started/installation.md) for our documentation on how to install, set up, and play the game.

## Contribution and Contact

Ideas, feedback, and bug reports are welcome! Either open an [issue](/issues) or feel free to contact us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/airwavegame.bsky.social).

We are also looking for advisors and experts to aid in ensuring that Airwave is as realistic as possible, so please do reach out!
